# BrowserUse_Usecase

## Overview
The BrowserUse library is a powerful tool that allows you to integrate AI capabilities into your web browser. It enables automation of various tasks by leveraging AI models, making your browsing experience more efficient and productive.

## Uses
- Automate repetitive tasks such as form filling, data extraction, and web scraping.
- Enhance productivity by using AI to draft emails, social media posts, and other content.
- Perform complex searches and data analysis directly within the browser.

## Giving AI Power to Browsers
To give AI power to your browser, you need to integrate an AI model with the BrowserUse library. This involves setting up the AI model, creating an agent, and defining tasks that the agent will perform.

## Potential Day-to-Day Use Cases
- **Content Creation**: Automatically generate blog posts, social media updates, and other content.
- **Data Analysis**: Extract and analyze data from websites for research or business intelligence.
- **Personal Assistance**: Automate scheduling, reminders, and other personal tasks.

## Implementing the Use Case
In this use case, we demonstrate how to create a detailed LinkedIn post on the topic of 'Gen AI' and automatically post it using the BrowserUse library.

### Steps:
1. **Initialize the AI Model**: We use the `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` model with the `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` configuration.
2. **Create an Agent**: The agent is tasked with creating a detailed LinkedIn post covering all aspects of 'Gen AI'.
3. **Define the Task**: The task includes writing the post using the AI model's knowledge and logging into LinkedIn to post the article.
4. **Run the Agent**: The agent generates the post, waits for user input, and then logs into LinkedIn to post the article.

### Example Code
```python
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
from browser_use import Agent
from pydantic import SecretStr
import asyncio
import os

api_key = os.getenv("GEMINI_API")
login_email = os.getenv("LOGIN")
login_password = os.getenv("PASSWORD")

# Initialize the model
llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model='gemini-2.0-flash-exp', api_key=SecretStr(api_key))

# Create agent with the model
async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Create script for a detailed, informative post for beginners on the topic of 'Gen AI'. Post should cover all the aspects in the given topic "
             "use only your knowledge instead of browsing to write the post. "
             "post should include the topic name, module name, a concise explanation, and a link to an additional resource for further guidance. "
             f"once the post is ready open the linkedin login and login using {login_email} and {login_password}. ONLY Proceed to LinkedIn login when post script is ready. once you receive my input go ahead and post this article on LinkedIn.", 
        llm=llm,
    )
    history = await agent.run()

    # Extract the structured result
    result = history.final_result()

asyncio.run(main())
```

This example demonstrates how to leverage the BrowserUse library and AI models to automate content creation and posting on social media platforms.
